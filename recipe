A bone-in rib steak, 1 ¼ to 1 ½ inches thick, will feed two. Scaling up is easy; just buy a thicker steak. A two-inch slab serves three to four, and it requires only a few extra minutes in the oven. Then add steaks as needed, bearing in mind that each one should cook in its own skillet.

INGREDIENTS
1 bone-in rib steak, 1 1/2 inches thick
1 garlic clove, halved
 Coarse kosher salt
 Black pepper

 PREPARATION
Heat a heavy ovenproof skillet (preferably cast iron) over high heat for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat your broiler.
Pat steak dry with paper towels, then vigorously rub cut side of garlic all over steak, particularly the bone. Season generously all over with salt and pepper.
Place steak in hot pan and carefully, using a potholder, transfer pan to broiler. Cook meat until done to taste, about 5 to 7 minutes for rare. Transfer steak to a cutting board, and let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
